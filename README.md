## Installation

### Add-on

For "Operating System" or "Supervised" installation methods, you can install ha-fusion as an add-on:

1. **Add Repository**: To begin, add the ha-fusion add-on repository to your Home Assistant instance. Click the button below or manually add the repository using this URL: <https://github.com/matt8707/addon-ha-fusion>.

   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmatt8707%2Faddon-ha-fusion)

2. **Install Add-on**: After adding the repository, refresh the add-on store page. Locate ha-fusion in the list and proceed with the installation.

### Docker

If you're using the "Container" or "Core" installation methods, ha-fusion can be installed via Docker:

1. **Docker Compose File**: Place your edited copy of the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/matt8707/ha-fusion/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file in a suitable directory.

2. **Create Container**:
   Run the following commands in your terminal to start the container:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/docker-compose.yml
   docker-compose up -d ha-fusion
   ```

#### Update

To update to the latest version of ha-fusion, run the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose pull ha-fusion
docker-compose up -d ha-fusion
```

   <b>Other</b>
</summary>

Without docker-compose, updating the container involves additional steps. For each update, it's necessary to first stop the current container, remove it, pull the new image, and then execute the docker run command again.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name ha-fusion \
  --network bridge \
  -p 5050:5050 \
  -v /path/to/ha-fusion:/app/data \
  -e TZ=Europe/Stockholm \
  -e HASS_URL=http://192.168.1.241:8123 \
  --restart always \
  ghcr.io/matt8707/ha-fusion
```

#### Kubernetes

If you prefer to use Kubernetes, see [Chart README.md](https://github.com/matt8707/ha-fusion/tree/167c320918544416e2f9272e1edad64b7329269a/charts/ha-fusion)

## Query strings

These will only function if you have exposed a port in the add-on configuration or by using Docker. Note that when using Ingress, query strings cannot be read.

### View

To set a particular view when the page loads, add the "view" parameter. For example, if you have a "Bedroom" view, append the query string `?view=Bedroom` to the URL.

### Menu

To disable the menu button, append the query string `?menu=false` to the URL. This is useful when you want to avoid unwanted changes to your dashboard, such as on wall-mounted tablets.
